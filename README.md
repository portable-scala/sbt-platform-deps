# sbt-platform-deps

Provides the `%%%` dependency builder for sbt.
This is used by Scala Native and/or Scala.js projects, including cross-compiling projects, to select the appropriate dependencies for the platform.

This project is only intended as a common dependency for the sbt plugins of Scala.js and Scala Native.
It should not be directly used.
